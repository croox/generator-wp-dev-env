		<h1 id="git-branching-model">Git branching model</h1>
<p>The branching model is inspired by <a href="https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/">Vincent Driessen's blog post on nvie.com</a>.</p>
<p>The following explanation summarizes this blog post and highlights some customization.</p>
<p>The repository, defined during initial project generation, is considered being a "central" repository and the source of "truth". Each developer pulls and pushes to this repository. We will refer to this repository as <code>origin</code>.</p>
<h2 id="branches-summary">Branches summary</h2>
<p>The repository constist of tree mandatory branches and temporary supporting branches.</p>
<h3 id="the-main-branches">The main branches</h3>
<p>The central repository holds three main branches with an infinite lifetime:</p>
<ul>
<li>master</li>
<li>develop</li>
<li>generated</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="master">master</h4>
<p>The <code>origin/master</code> branch is considered to be the main branch where the source code of <code>HEAD</code> always reflects the latest release.</p>
<h4 id="develop">develop</h4>
<p>The <code>origin/develop</code> branch is considered to be the main branch where the source code of <code>HEAD</code> always reflects a state with the latest delivered development changes for the next release.</p>
<p>Features and fixes are developed in individual temporary branches and integrated into the <code>origin/develop</code> branch. We will refer to those branches as "Supporting branches".</p>
<p>When the source code in this branch reaches a stable point and is ready to be released, all of the changes should be merged back into <code>master</code>, to be ready to run the <code>grunt dist</code> task to release a new version from the <code>master</code> branch.</p>
<h4 id="generated">generated</h4>
<p>The source code of <code>origin/generated</code> branch should not be edited manually. It reflects the state of a fresh generated project without changes.</p>
<p>This branch is created during initial project generation and updated when the project gets regenerated.</p>
<p>The purpose of this branch is to prepare a base to update the project to a new generator version.</p>
<p>On regeneration (run <code>yo</code> and choose to "Regenerate Project") the project gets generated with the same input parameter but uses the templates from the current globally installed <code>generator-wp-dev-env</code>. Once the <code>generated</code> branch is updated, the changes should be merged manually into the <code>develop</code> branch.</p>
<h3 id="supporting-branches">Supporting branches</h3>
<p>Next to the main branches, a variety of supporting branches are used to aid parallel development.<br />
Each of this branches has a specific purpose like developing a certain feature or fix an issue.<br />
These branches always have a limited life time, since they will be removed eventually.</p>
<p>A supporting branch is bound to strict rules as to which branch it is originating from and which branch is it will be merged into.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/#supporting-branches">Vincent Driessen's blog post</a> for a detailed explanation about that concept and how to work with that model.</p>
<p>It is up to the development team to determine to what extent it makes use of supporting branches. Only the main branches and at least on <code>release-*</code> branch are mandatory.</p>
<h4 id="release-"><code>release-*</code></h4>
<p>At least one <code>release-*</code> branch is mandatory. Because <strong>new versions can only be released from a <code>release-*</code> branch</strong>.<br />
The <a href="../Command/dist.html"><code>grunt dist</code></a> task will perform all necessary steps.</p>
