### What happens on `build`, `watch` and `dist`

#### Copy and string-replace

All subdirectories and files are copied into the corresponding destination directory. E.g.: `./src/custom_dir_to_include/*` will be copied to `./test_build/custom_dir_to_include`.

For all `php` files, certain patterns will be replaced. See [`build`](../Command/build.html#copy-and-string-replace).
